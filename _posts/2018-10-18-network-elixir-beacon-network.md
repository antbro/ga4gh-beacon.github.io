Beacon networks consist of registries of multiple Beacons, in different locations, which can be queried through a common intercace or gateway protocol.

The _ELIXIR Beacon Network_ is a collection of Beacons from ELIXIR nodes, which - among other features - implement controlled access options by leveraging the [ELIXIR AAI](https://www.elixir-europe.org/services/compute/aai).
