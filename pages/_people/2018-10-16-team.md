The __ELIXIR Beacon__ project enables both the discovery of public research data - through the development of the Beacon specification - as well as the querying of research consented sensitive human genetic data stored in databases affiliated with ELIXIR Nodes and in the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA).

Extending the GA4GH Beacon technology, the project is developing common interface to streamline and simplify access to these resources using ELIXIR Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure. __ELIXIR Beacon__ involves partners from eight ELIXIR Nodes: EMBL-EBI, Belgium, Finland, France, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
