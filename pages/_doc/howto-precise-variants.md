## {{ page.title }}

Precise variants are such with annotated sequences of 0....n length, and bases 
of [ATCGN] for the `referenceBases` and `alternateBases` attributes (N for 
"not specified").

Examples for variant queries can be found in the 
["Example Queries"](/howto/query-examples.html) documentation.
