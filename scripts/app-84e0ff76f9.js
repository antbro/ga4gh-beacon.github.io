<img src="assets/images/faq.png" width="10%" height="10%"> Beacon FAQs</h2></div> <br><br> <div><h3>- What is a “Beacon” and what type of personal information does it contain? </h3></div> <div> A Beacon is an online web service that allows users to query an institution’s databases to determine whether they contain a genetic variant of interest. The query is structured as a yes/no question of the form: "Do you have any genomes with an \'X\' at position Y on chromosome Z?" Currently 19 organizations are sharing yes/no information about the existence of genetic variants as part of the GA4GH Beacon Network. Supporting the Beacon API on top of an existing database takes only minutes to implement. </div> <div><h3> - What is the Beacon Project doing to mitigate the possibility and likelihood of reidentification through Beacons?</h3></div> <div> Since its inception, the Beacon Project has been actively working with experts in GA4GH’s membership to mitigate any potential privacy concerns. <br> These efforts include: <li>A data aggregation approach, in which several private Beacons are combined into a single public Beacon. The power to re-identify is a function of the number of data points served by a Beacon and the scope of the data it contains (i.e. whole genome versus exome). Aggregate Beacons contain more data points and do not obscure the origin of the data. </li><li>An information budgeting approach to track the cumulative information revealed to any one user and restrict access if information disclosure exceeds a threshold. The power to re-identify an individual varies inversely with the frequency of the alleles being queried. That is, very rare alleles reveal more about a given individual than those that are common among the population. By metering the information disclosure, Beacons can restrict access before reidentification is possible. </li><li>Secured access to some of the data. Before a user is approved to access data, s/he must provide credentials and/or research plans and agree not to re-identify individu </li></div> <div><h3>- Why are Beacons important to global genomic data sharing and why is global genomic data sharing important in the first place?</h3></div> <div> Beacons present an easy-to-implement strategy for determining whether an institution has genomic data in its data set that would be useful to share. Those data are only as useful as the comparisons that can be made against them across hundreds of thousands ― even millions ― of individuals. Since no single institution can collect such large samples on its own, sharing is critical for genomic data to have a transformative impact on human health and disease. The initial yes/no query step is not only an interesting exercise about the willingness to share, but it also has the potential to save researchers countless hours tracking down useful data for their work. </div> <div><h3>4) What do institutions commit to when they join the Beacon Network? </h3></div> <div> When an institution “lights” a Beacon, it demonstrates its willingness and ability to share data. The organizations in the Beacon Network have created online search functions that let anyone in the world know if a certain allele exists in their datasets ― but only to find a particular kind of information that was carefully chosen not to overly expose genomic data to privacy or security risks. The rapid growth of the Beacon Project shows that many institutions across the globe are interested in working together to break down silos and share genomic information in innovative and responsible ways. </div> <div><h3>- How is sharing data through Beacon different from traditional medical practice? </h3></div> <div> In current medical practice, doctors commonly share basic, de-identified information about patients’ conditions and genetic variations in the hopes of matching a second case that could be therapeutically transformative. This practice is a long-standing tradition in the medical community but it is neither standardized nor optimized. The Beacon Project turns that informal transaction into a more efficient and effective search that can be a key initial step for learning from valuable genomic information. <br> Since much of that information is currently collected and held in silos, researchers lack the broad-scale ability to know whether similar data exist that could provide important learning when combined with their own data. <br> The Beacon Project was created both to test the willingness of organizations to share at the most basic, yes/no level, and also to allow researchers to understand if a specific allele exists in other data sets. Now that a Beacon Network has been created, researchers have the ability to discover valuable information within organizations that have lit Beacons. This is often a needed first step to aggregate and learn from largescale genomic data. </div> <br><br><br> </div> </div> </div> '),e.put("app/info/event.html",'<div id="ds-contact" class="row dn-content bn-hero-white"> <div class="col-xs-12 dn-splash-event b-b p-v-xxl hidden-xs"> <div class="p-v-xl"></div> </div> <div id="ds-press" class="row bn-hero-white"> <div class="mx-width clearfix p-v-xxl"> <div class="col-xs-12"> <br><br> <h2 class="h2 p-v-xl"><img src="assets/images/event.png" width="40" heigt="40"> Events </h2> </div> <div class="col-xs-12"> <div class="row m-t-lg"> <table class="newstable" width="80%" align="center"> <tr><th nowrap=""> Name </th><th nowrap=""> Location </th><th nowrap=""> Date</th><th></th></tr> <tr ng-repeat="conference in event.conf"> <td>{{conference.title}}</td> <td>{{conference.where}}</td> <td nowrap="">{{conference.date}} </td> <td><a href="{{conference.url}}" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/url.png" width="22" height="22"></a></td> </tr> </table> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="ds-press" class="row bn-hero-white"> <div class="mx-width clearfix p-v-xxl"> <div class="col-xs-12"> <h2 class="h2 p-v-xl"><img src="assets/images/news.png" width="40" heigt="40"> Recent communications </h2> </div> <div class="col-xs-12"> <div class="row m-t-lg"> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4" style="margin-bottom: 10px" ng-repeat="story in event.news"> <div class="b-a bg-light" style="padding:10px;

the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) calls for a federated data ecosystem for sharing genomic and clinical data. The authorship, which includes DNAstack CEO and co-founder Marc Fiume, as well as a diverse team of international leaders in academia, research, medicine, and industry, argues that a common framework of principles, protocols, and interoperable technical systems are necessary to enable responsible and effective data sharing. </p> <p> GA4GH was established in 2013 to bring the community together to build the tools and establish the standards necessary to achieve that goal. Today, it counts more than 400 organizations and more than 700 individuals in its membership, which spans more than 70 countries. &quot;These stakeholders are working together across traditional boundaries to create the common framework that will allow us to make best use of the millions of genome sequences that currently sit in siloed databases around the globe,&quot; says Peter Goodhand, GA4GH Executive Director and a member of the author group. </p> <figure> <img src="assets/images/paper.png"> <figcaption> <strong>A federated data ecosystem.</strong> To share genomic data globally, this approach furthers medical research without requiring compatible data sets or compromising patient identity.</figcaption> </figure> <p> &quot;The seminal work conducted by the GA4GH paves the way for an information highway in genomics that will connect a global network of data sharing organizations to accelerate discoveries in genomics research and the delivery of precision medicine,&quot; says Fiume, who is also Project Lead on the GA4GH Beacon Project. </p> <p> To date, GA4GH has created a toolkit of diverse products, including the Genomics API, which allows disparate technology services to exchange genotypic and phenotypic data, as well as the Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health Related Data, which outlines the basic principles and core elements for responsible data sharing. GA4GH has also catalyzed the development of three data sharing projects which aim to illustrate the value of sharing data in real world contexts. These consist of (i) an open-ended approach to sharing data across the Internet (the Beacon Project), (ii) an international collaboration among breast cancer genetics experts (the BRCA Challenge), and (iii) a peer-to- peer network of clinicians (Matchmaker Exchange). </p> <p> In addition to outlining successes, the paper notes a variety of remaining challenges to sharing data across national and institutional boundaries. For example, the membership is currently working on solutions to secure data access while maximizing the scope of information that can be shared, to create tools that are flexible enough to be readily implemented in different knowledge domains, and to establish sustainable funding models that support data curation, hosting, and computation. </p> <p> &quot;Private funders and national governments will need to be involved on some level to support these activities so that clinicians and scientists may access as much free, curated data as possible,&quot; says Mike Stratton, Director of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, CEO of the Wellcome Genome Campus, and a member of the GA4GH Strategic Advisory Board. &quot;The Sanger Institute has supported the Global Alliance since its inception as we are committed to helping researchers and clinicians access and freely share the genomic and related health data they need to transform human health.&quot; </p> <p> &quot;Millions of genome sequences are being generated around the globe, but to gain the full benefits from these data — to advance human health and to prevent and treat disease — laboratory and clinical investigators will need more effective means of access to data, regardless of where the data are stored,&quot; said Professor Harold Varmus of Weill Cornell Medical College, former Director of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, and Chair of the GA4GH Scientific Advisory Board. &quot;The only way to do that is for the global community to come together across traditional boundaries — be they national, institutional, or technical — to create a federated ecosystem that works for everyone. The GA4GH has begun to do that in the projects described in this new report.&quot; </p> <p> The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health is an international, non-profit alliance formed to accelerate the potential of genomic medicine to advance human health. Bringing together over 400 leading organizations working in healthcare, research, disease and patient advocacy, life science, and information technology, GA4GH Members are working together to create a common framework of tools, methods, and harmonized approaches and supporting demonstration projects to enable the responsible, voluntary, and secure sharing of genomic and clinical data. </p> '),e.put("app/press/articles/2016-10-17-launch.html",'<h2 class="h2">DNAstack launches genomics cloud platform to accelerate disease research and precision medicine</h2> <div class="m-b-xl"> <p>Share this story on</p> <a class="btn btn-xs btn-primary" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/home?status=%40DNAstack%20launches%20cloud%20%23genomics%20platform%20to%20accelerate%20disease%20research%20and%20precision%20medicine%20%40GA4GH%20%40googlecloud"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-twitter"></i> Twitter</a> <a class="btn btn-xs btn-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A//dnastack.com/%23/press/2016-10-17-launch&title=DNAstack%20launches%20genomics%20cloud%20platform%20to%20accelerate%20disease%20research%20and%20precision%20medicine&summary=&source="><i class="fa fa-fw fa-linkedin m-r-sm"></i> LinkedIn</a> </div> <p> Toronto, Ontario, Canada (October 17, 2016) — DNAstack, a Toronto-based genomic software company, today announced the launch of its cloud platform to accelerate genetic disease research and precision medicine. DNAstack provides push-button access to state-of-the-art genomics data analysis and sharing to help scientists more quickly and cost-effectively make sense of the world’s exponentially accumulating genomics data and break down barriers to data sharing. </p> <figure> <img src="assets/images/product/web-workflow-overview.svg"> </figure> <p> DNAstack is a simple, scalable, secure solution that enables management, analysis, search, and sharing of genomics datasets in the cloud. To accelerate adoption of best practices bioinformatics and open standards in data sharing, DNAstack is offering these features for free, where users pay only for cloud costs incurred for data storage and computation on the Google Cloud. DNAstack is the first commercial platform to be built on Google Genomics and is compliant with standards developed by the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health (GA4GH). </p> <p> The company is paving the way for an &quot;internet of genomes&quot; that will help connect a global network of data sharing organizations. &quot;The internet has vastly improved our ability to share and learn from a global knowledgebase that grows in real-time,&quot; said Dr. Marc Fiume, CEO of DNAstack. &quot;But for the most part, due to a lack of standards and simple web-accessible tools to adopt them, genomics data have been siloed from the most effective medium we have for sharing information, the internet.&quot; </p> <p> The path of genomics data from sequencing to medical impact is a long and windy one. DNAstack believes this can be shortened by connecting repositories into shared networks that can be analyzed in real-time. Dr. Fiume chairs the Beacon Project as part of the GA4GH, which develops an open standard for global federated sharing of genomic information between organizations, recently described in <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6291/1278">Science</a>. Through this work, DNAstack has developed the <a href="http://beacon-network.org">Beacon Network</a>, which has quickly grown to become one of the largest search engines for publicly shared genetic variants in the world. </p> <p> &quot;Sharing data is key to unlocking insights about disease that wouldn’t otherwise be possible,&quot; said Peter Goodhand, Executive Director at GA4GH. &quot;DNAstack is contributing to global efforts to enable sharing of genomic and clinical data to advance human health. We are pleased to see that DNAstack is utilizing and sharing GA4GH tools, including the Genomics API, to allow its users to join federated networks of data sharing and knowledge exchange that are driving greater understanding of genomics, cancer, and rare disease.&quot; </p> <p> DNAstack is already being used to support world-class research in Toronto. &quot;The genomes of patients with rare and complex disorders are unique,&quot; said Dr. Stephen Scherer, Director of The Centre for Applied Genomics at The Hospital for Sick Children and the Autism Speaks MSSNG Genome Sequencing Project. &quot;Collection, sharing, and analysis of millions of genomes will be necessary to develop a precise understanding of the genetic underpinnings of disease. DNAstack is developing much-needed technologies to support advancement in disease research through its integrated solution that marries analytical software tools with emerging global standards for open-science and collaboration.&quot; </p> <h4 class="h4">About DNAstack</h4> <p> DNAstack develops a cloud-based platform for genomics data analysis and sharing.
