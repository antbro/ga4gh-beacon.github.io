## Why are Beacons important to global genomic data sharing and why is global genomic data sharing important in the first place?

Beacons present an easy-to-implement strategy for determining whether an institution has genomic data in its data set that would be useful to share.

Those data are only as useful as the comparisons that can be made against them across hundreds of thousands ― even millions ― of individuals. Since no single institution can collect such large samples on its own, sharing is critical for genomic data to have a transformative impact on human health and disease. The initial yes/no response step is not only an interesting exercise about the willingness to share, but it also has the potential to save researchers countless hours tracking down useful data for their work.
