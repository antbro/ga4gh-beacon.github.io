# Beacon Project website

This is the working code for the ELIXIR Beacon Project website. ELIXIR Beacons provide discovery services for genomic data in the [European Genome-phenome Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/home) (EGA) and in ELIXIR Nodes, using the Beacon technology developed by the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](https://www.ga4gh.org/) (GA4GH).

For more information see the [ELIXIR website](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/beacons).
