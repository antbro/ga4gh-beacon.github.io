Beacon is an open standard for genomics data discovery, developed by members of the [Global Alliance for Genomics &amp; Health](http://genomicsandhealth.org).

The Beacon project is a project to test the willingness of international sites to share genetic data in the simplest of all technical contexts. It is defined as a simple public web service that any institution can implement as a service.

The service is designed merely to accept a query of the form "Do you have any genomes with an 'A' at position 100,735 on chromosome 3" (or similar data) and responds with one of "Yes" or "No." A site offering this service is called a "beacon".

This open web service is designed to be technically simple, easy to implement, and to not return privacy violating information.

The Beacon protocol was designed to be :

* Simple
* Federated : maintained by individual organizations and assembled into a network.
* General-purpose : used to distribute any allelic dataset.
* Aggregative : provide a boolean answer to whether an allele was observed.
